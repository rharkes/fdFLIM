# Frequency Domain Fluorescence Lifetime Analysis

Analysis of Lambert Instruments .fli files. 

Can calculate:
* phase and modulation of a single n-phase image
* lifetime from phase using reference data with a known lifetime
* lifetime from modulation using reference data with a known lifetime
* the mean sum of squared errors for the fit in each pixel.

An example macro that opens and thresholds a .fli file and thresholds the image on intensity can be found here:
